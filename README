Utility stl-secator is intended to make cross section of 3D object stored in ASCII STL file by the plane z = 0.
Utility admesh cans convert binary STL to ASCII STL.
The result of stl-secator is SVG files.
They are parts of one big poster (in general case) to be printed on small printer and pasted together.
Moreover, stl-secator outputs in stdout a data of cross section to display its by gnuplot for example.
Different messages are directed into the stderr.

Tested on Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)

Usage:
  stl-secator [options] <ascii_stl_file>

Options:
	--z=C     		Plane z = C makes a cross section.
          			C is float, millimeters.
          			By default 0.
  --margin=n    Width of empty fields in edges on page for pasting together of a few pages.
                n is float, millimeters.
                By default 10.
  --format=x:y  Format of the paper.
                x, y are float, millimeters.
                By default format A4: x = 210, y = 297.
  --dpi=n       Dots per inch, integer.
                It will be needed to set the same value before printing in a program for printing (Gimp, for example).
                By default 600.
  --no-legend   Do not print markers in SVG pictures.
                By default false.
  --no-preview  Do not create preview SVG file.
                By default false.

Example:
  ./stl-secator --z=250 --margin=15 --format=297:420 boat.stl &>/dev/null
